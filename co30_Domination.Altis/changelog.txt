- Added: Player suppression, can be disabled in params "Player can be suppressed" or d_with_suppress in description.ext
- Added: If d_with_mhq_camo is enabled it is now possible too deploy a mhq without camo net by selecting it with the "Deploy with camo net" checkbox
- Changed: CAS with very short cooldown (90 secs) if artillery is set to unlimited, by longtimegamer
- Changed: Added visibility check for player and AI names over the head, means, players see the names above head if the unit is visible and not all the time
- Fixed: If a player can escape jail with a mod like enhanced movement put him back again into the jail if he is too far away; if he does it 10 times then the player will be banned for the running session
- Fixed: Object compositions were placed half in the ground on CUP Winter Chernarus
- Fixed: Event triggers now have a defined height to prevent flyovers from triggering ground events, by longtimegamer
- Fixed: In ranked mode players with rank private ended up with just one uniform in Virtual Arsenal
- Fixed: incorrect logic in maintarget event selection, improved dashboard list and line breaks, by longtimegamer
- Improved: Make use of new A3 2.02 scripting commands where possible
- Improved: Use new import keyword to load UI configs from the game itself rather than copying them into description.ext
- Improved security: The following scripting commands can no longer be executed over the network when remoteexec mode is set to 1: setVariable, switchMove, setDir, hideObjectGlobal, endMission, setCaptive and addScore
- Added slightly more debug output (possible with improved A3 logging)
- And more optimizations
