4.60

- Fixed: ACE medic/engineer trait not set, by Wazzledi
- Fixed: If a side mission created by marker(s) doesn't exist take the next one instead of throwing an error
- Fixed: Don't select alive mobile respawn vehicles for respawn
- Optimized: DB top players are no longer a huge public variable (please note that the domination.sqf file in the @InterceptDB folder has changed)
