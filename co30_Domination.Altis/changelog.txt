- Fixed: AI medic revive routine did not end when a player was already revived
- Fixed: When the main target was done it could happen that destroying a barracks building or AI vehicle MHQ at the old main target triggered variable change for the new main target
- Fixed: Putting players in jail was not working at all
- Fixed: Script error because of wrong blacklist area in jail script
- Improved: Destroying vehicles at base check
- Improved: Cleanup routines after main target (should no longer cause performance issues)
